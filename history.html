                           <h1>Hyderabad</h1>
                           <p>Hyderābād City (Haidarābād) (Sindhi: حیدرآباد‎, Urdu: حیدرآباد‎ ), headquarters of the district of Sindh province of Pakistan 
                               traces its early history to Neroon, a Sindhi ruler of the area from whom the city derived its previous name, Neroon Kot.
                                Its history dates back to medieval times, when Ganjo Takker (Barren Hill), a nearby hilly tract, was used as a place of worship. 
                                Lying on the most northern hill of the Ganjo Takker ridge, just east of the river Indus, it is the third largest city in the province 
                                and the eighth largest in the country with an expanse over three hillocks part of the most northerly hills of the Ganjo Takker range,
                                 32 miles east of the Indus with which it is connected by various routes leading to Gidu Bandar.

                            Hyderabad, as the historic capital of Sindh, is the centre of all the provincial communications: road, rail, waterways and air. From the date of its foundation (1768), 
                            its manufactures-ornamented silks, silver- and gold-work, and lacquered ware-have been the chief in the province, and during its heyday had
                             gained prizes at the industrial exhibitions of Europe. Some noteworthy antiquities are the tombs' of the Kalhora jagirani and Talpur rulers.</p>

                        <h1>The Early Settlement</h1>
                        <p>The area around Hyderabad was an agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period is 
                            characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in Indus Valley.
                            Under the rule of a local ruler Neroon, this small fishing village thrived upon the banks of the mighty Indus river. 
                            A nearby hill tract called the Ganjo Takker or the bald (barren) hill, later attributed to as the Ganjo Range by British 
                            occupants, protected the town raising it above the level of the water and safe from flood calamities that were regular in 
                            neighbouring regions. Of popular tradition, the place came to be known as Neroon Kot نيرون ڪوٽ. Neroon Kot literally means 
                            the place where Neroon came from.
                            The Ganjo Takker ridge lay on a low limestone range and was used as a place of worship by the most adherent  
                            religious priests that blessed the city believing their meditation may result in excellent trade networks the city was developing at the time. But these very particular popularity traits in the areas of trade led the city vulnerable to outside sieges. Equipped mostly with farming equipment, the locals were attacked by the conquest of Islamic armies circa 711 CE and surrendered. Neroon was dethroned.</p>

                        <h1>The Kalhora Dynasty</h1>
                        <p>The River Indus was changing course around 1757 due to Monsoons resulting in periodic floods and devastating the banks of the river. 
                            Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhora was admired as the saintly ruler of Sindh at the time his capital Khudabad near Dadu was repeatedly flooded. 
                            Being fed up, he decided to move his capital to a better place.
                            The present day city of Hyderabad was founded in 1768 on the site of the ancient town of Neroon Kot by Ghulam Shah Kalhora of the Kalhora
                             Dynasty it remained the chief town of Sindh until 1843, when, after the battle of Miani, it surrendered to the British, and the capital was
                              transferred to Karachi.It was named after the prophet Mohammed's son-in-law, Ali, also known as Haidar.   
                            Surviving as a small fishing village on the banks of River Indus, the city was suddenly called the heart of the
                             Mehran. Thriving upon the fresh river water's banks, Hyderabad was much loved by Ghulam Shah. He admired the city so
                              much that in 1766, he ordered a fort to be built on one of the three hills of Hyderabad to house and defend his people. 
                              The massive half-a-square kilometer (about 36 acres) garrison was completed by 1768. Since then, it stands in place and is 
                              called the Pacco Qillo پڪو قلعو or the strong fort. The Kalhora rule lasted for two more decades until the demise of the great Ghulam 
                              Shah.</p>
